				<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a very comprehensive JavaScript library for visualizing data. When I first looked at the capabilities of D3 I was overwhelmed with a huge range of different examples created with D3. There are numerous kinds of visualizations of data that can be formed with D3, including bubble charts and wave graphs. Because it has such a wide range of uses, I found this library to be difficult to use at first. Although it is initially confusing, it is very effective in terms of being able to take data and represent it in your method of choice. D3 also uses SVG, which is the technology used to create scalable graphical elements. The D3 library has revolutionized visualization by making it easier to parse data and add meaningful interactivity. The data I used was from a JSON file which D3 uses to read and gather the content to then display.

			<p>My final design is based on my idea for the final project. It is going to show a map of California and for users to then explore and learn more about waste and environmental pollution facts. For studio 4, I choose to only use three cities within California to highlight some places without using a database for information right now. I think the interface is clear and simple because the map is not overwhelming and people can easily find what is important to click on. The tool tips also provide pertinent information without making the users wait too long for a response. Later I would like to fill this data in with more detailed and accurate information from a database. Overall the interface is very minimalistic but very clear for users. Another reason the interface is clear is due to the different colors of the cities as well as the coordinated color for the tool tip.

			<p>My final design is based on Rupi Kaur's book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Milk-Honey-Rupi-Kaur/dp/1508229619"> Milk and Honey.</a> Milk and Honey is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. I chose her book because I found her poems to be very beautifully poignant and although I do not collect items, I have several screenshots of pages in her book. Three solutions I used are hover, click, and the grid layout. When users hover over the images, color is added to the photos which supports effective and interesting interface design. Secondly, when users want to learn further about the photo, he or she or they recieves further feedback when they click the image to reveal the poem. When the user clicks again the photo is displayed again and they can hover to the other images to learn more. Another aspect about my solution that provides great interface design is the use of the grid and images. This way the users are not overwhelemed with text only from the poems and view the images as more of an introduction to the poems.

			<p>Google forms is a tool I often use for my club events. It allows you to select from multiple question types, drag-and-drop to reorder questions and customize values as easily as pasting a list. I also enjoy forms because you can send professional looking surveys to customers. These are great looking surveys help you connect with customers to gain valuable insights. Another feauture I like it that you can able to add images, videos, and custom logic to give people who respond a great survey experience <br> </br> The interface is very clear and uses drag and drop to create the forms. Data validation rules can make sure email addresses are properly formatted, dates are correct and that people get the right questions based on their previous answers. Google Forms allows users to create questions and analyze results together, which is a very helpful feauture and reduces the need for other web apps.

			<p>A user interface that I use often is Google photos. It offers convenient organizational features for users to be able to categorize their photos by time period, location, or person. As a person with a full camera roll, this makes it easier for me to organize and easily access photos that I need on a cloud platform with unlimited storage. The layout of Google photos is very simple and minimalistic. On the home page, there is a search bar on the top of the page and the photos are shown in a grid in reverse chronological order. <br> </br>
			On the assistant page there are also GIFs and albums that Google Photos creates for users. Users can then click to save these if the user wishes to. This makes the photos more than just photos and adds values for users to use google photos over just a cloud storage app. Because there is a simple grid layout on each page, this makes it very easy for users to understand the layout and function of the features google photos offers. I think that effective design should have  repetitive layout so users can quickly and more easily learn how to use the interface and then later successfully make the most of the features in the app or website.
