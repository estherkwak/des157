			<p>A user interface that I use often is Google photos. It offers convenient organizational features for users to be able to categorize their photos by time period, location, or person. As a person with a full camera roll, this makes it easier for me to organize and easily access photos that I need on a cloud platform with unlimited storage. The layout of Google photos is very simple and minimalistic. On the home page, there is a search bar on the top of the page and the photos are shown in a grid in reverse chronological order. <br> </br>
			On the assistant page there are also GIFs and albums that Google Photos creates for users. Users can then click to save these if the user wishes to. This makes the photos more than just photos and adds values for users to use google photos over just a cloud storage app. Because there is a simple grid layout on each page, this makes it very easy for users to understand the layout and function of the features google photos offers. I think that effective design should have  repetitive layout so users can quickly and more easily learn how to use the interface and then later successfully make the most of the features in the app or website.
