<h1>Audience Test</h1>

<p>My target audience test allowed me to test features of my website. I wanted to see how my users interact with the navigation bar, if they used the up-scroll arrow, and how they interacted with the map. These three features are critical aspects of my project and I wanted my audience to interact with these three features and explain where they had confusion, if any, and what they enjoyed about these features. </p>
