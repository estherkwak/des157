	<h1>3 topic ideas for ISEA</h1>

  <h3>Topic 1: Visualization of animal species</h3>
  <p>
D3.js is a powerful graphics visualization library that allows large data sets to be visualized in a manner that not only looks beautiful, but offers complexity and relevance to expose the critical parts of the data set. For the topic of Bio Creation/Data, a webpage detailing the extinction of animal species over time with d3.js, with a visualization of all the animal species and how they are connected, and how they are slowly becoming extinct because of global warming
  </p>
  <h3>Topic 2: The extinction of bees </h3>
  <p>A powerful website could be created to visualize the process of bees from pollenating plants to producing honey. These animations could be created by leveraging scrolling in html, to animate this process and expose the phenomena, which is the rapidly decreasing population of bees, which are so critical in the food chain.
  </p>
  <h3>Topic 3: Machine Learning</h3>
  <p>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are beginning to be utilized in a lot of electronics, beginning with the introduction of siri, alexa, and reaching the point where autonomous cars are quickly becoming a reality. With this in mind, how dangerous can this become? An animated infographic could be show to expose the reality of autonomous driving or a similar epidemic of artificial intelligence/machine learning becoming more powerful, and force people to carefully question the decisions that autonomous driving/robotic algorithms make, which potentially can affect the future of the human race.
